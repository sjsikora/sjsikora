# Hello, I am Sam!

## About me
- I got my start as a coder when I built a computer in middle school (Cliche, I know).
- I am currently an undergrad in computer science at UBC Okanagan.
- Currently, I am bouncing between Seattle, Washington ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and Kelowna, British Columbia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.
- I am super interested in the specific biological questions that can be answered with deep learning!

## How do I use Github?
I use Github mainly to support the development of personal projects. I am still learning, so these are ways to get experience by doing.

## What am I working on now?

ðŸ¦  - **Label Transfer Algorithm**: As part of my internship at the Trapnell Lab, I am working closely with the R package monocle3 to develop a pipeline to transfer labels from a reference to a query dataset accurately. 

ðŸ“± - **???**: A project that I am not quite ready to announce. However, I will say it is a React app built with Firebase.

## What are some old projects?
