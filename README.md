# Hello, I am Sam Sikora (he/him)!

## About me
- I got my start as a coder when I built a computer in middle school (Cliche, I know).
- I am currently an undergrad in computer science at UBC Okanagan.
- Currently, I am bouncing between Seattle, Washington 🇺🇸 and Kelowna, British Columbia 🇨🇦.
- I am super interested in biological questions that can be answered with deep learning!

## How do I use Github?
I use Github mainly to support the development of personal projects. I am still learning, so these are ways to get experience by doing.

## What am I working on now?

🦠 **Label Transfer Algorithm**: As part of my internship at the Trapnell Lab, I am working closely with the R package monocle3 to develop a pipeline to transfer labels from a reference to a query dataset accurately. 

📱 **???**: A React app built with Firebase that I am not quite ready to announce.

## What are some old projects?

- 📈 **Dash Data Visualization** Variational Auto Encoder Double Knockout Data, Olympic Rowing Data
- 👩‍🏫 **UBC Class API**
-
