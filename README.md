# Hello, I am Sam!

## About me 🤔
- I got my (cliche) start as a coder when I built a computer in middle school.
- I am currently an undergrad in Computer Science major at UBC Okanagan.

## How do I use Github?
I use Github mainly to support the development of personal projects. I am still learning, so these are ways to get experience by doing.

## What am I working on now?

🦠 - **Label Transfer Algorithm**: As part of my internship at the Trapnell Lab, I am working closely with the R package monocle3 to develop a pipeline to transfer labels from a reference to a query dataset accurately. 

📱 - **???**: A project that I am not quite ready to announce, however it is an React app built with Firebase.
