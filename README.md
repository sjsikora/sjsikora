# Hello, I am Sam Sikora (he/him)!

## About me
I am...
- currently an undergrad in computer science at UBC Okanagan.
- bouncing between Seattle, Washington 🇺🇸 and Kelowna, British Columbia 🇨🇦.
- a rock climber! Find me at your local crag, being bullied by my sport climbing friends to go leading!
- trying my hardest to learn Vim keybinds. Now, at a point where I can, almost, navigate through my files mouse-free!
  
## What am I working on now?

📱 [**Telepole**](https://github.com/sjsikora/telepole): *React/Typescript* A full-stack website to track telephone poles in Seattle and Kelowna.

🌳 [**IDS Solar Bench**](https://github.com/IDS-Solar-Bench/backserver): I am the Director of Software Integration for UBCO's IDS (Innovate, Design, Sustain) Solar Bench Project. Specifically, my role in the Solar Bench project is to retrieve data from a microcontroller and display it on a website. This project is slated to be completed by May 2026.

## What are some old projects?

- 🛸 [**EarthLingo**](https://github.com/sjsikora/EarthLingo): *React/Typescript/Microsoft Azure AI* Pick or customize your sentence, and then read it aloud. EarthLingo will give you feedback on your overall pronunciation of the sentence, highlight any mispronounced words, and help you break down your worst pronunciation. Additionally, for every sentence you read, you are scored on individual phonics so you can understand your weak points.
- 🦠 [**Label Transfer Algorithm**](https://github.com/sjsikora/bayesian-scRNAseq-label-transfer): *R* As part of my internship at the Trapnell Lab, I developed a pipeline to transfer cell labels from a reference to a query single-cell dataset accurately.
- 📈 **Dash Data Visualization**: *Python* A website to view and interact with Variational Auto Encoder Double Knockout Data, Olympic Rowing Data, Supreme Court Data, and Genetically Engineered Crop Data.
- 👩‍🏫 [**UBC Class API**](https://github.com/sjsikora/UBC-Class-Api): *Python* Turns UBC Class data into JSON files.
- 🎵 [**Playlist Board**](https://github.com/sjsikora/Playlist-Board): *Python* Turn your top listened-to albums into a photo to share with your friends.
- 📷 [**Photo/Birthday Discord Bot**](https://github.com/sjsikora/Discord-Bot): *Javascript* Can never remember your friends birthdays? Or do you want to find an embarrassing photo of them? This bot will manage the photos and birthdays of the members of your server. NOTE: This project is private due to it containing sensitive information. Please reach out personally if you would like to view it.
