## What am I working on now?

Currently focusing on schoolwork and applying to new-grad roles for the Summer of 2026!

## What are some old projects?

- 🤖 **Microsoft Internship** *Python/Microsoft Foundry* Over the Summer of 2025, I developed an agentic AI system that provides on-call engineers with critical contextual information during system failure triage. This included creating and deploying multiple LLM agents on Microsoft Azure to parse customer reports, analyze internal logs for root cause identification, and surface similar historical issues.
- 🎓 [**Course Registration System**](https://github.com/sjsikora/COSC310Group) *Python/SQL/Docker* For a project management course, my group and I developed a full-stack desktop course registration system. The application was designed to help administrators efficiently manage student records, classes, and grades. It provides both admin and student interfaces for streamlined enrollment, profile management, and academic progress tracking.
- 🍃 **Get Green Admin Console** *React* For my Summer 2024 internship, I created a website with React and Vite to manage customer accounts.
- 🧭 [**Tourist Helper App**](https://github.com/sjsikora/TouristHelperApp) *Java/Android Studio* As part of my human-computer interaction course, my group and I created a full-stack Android Studio app for tourists to Kelowna to help plan and manage their itineraries. Tourists can search and scroll through local events, add activities to their itinerary, see a timeline of their trips, and event coordinators can add new events to the app!
- 🌳 [**IDS Solar Bench**](https://github.com/IDS-Solar-Bench/backserver): *React/Docker/MQTT*I was the Director of Software Integration for UBCO's IDS (Innovate, Design, Sustain) Solar Bench Project. Specifically, my role in the Solar Bench project involves retrieving data from a microcontroller and displaying it on a website. My work is on the back burner while the physical bench gets approved and built.
- 🛸 [**EarthLingo**](https://github.com/sjsikora/EarthLingo): *React/Typescript/Microsoft Azure AI* Pick or customize your sentence, and then read it aloud. EarthLingo will give you feedback on your overall pronunciation of the sentence, highlight any mispronounced words, and help you break down your worst pronunciation. Additionally, for every sentence you read, you are scored on individual phonics, so you can understand your weak points.
- 📱 [**Telepole**](https://github.com/sjsikora/telepole): *React/Typescript* A full-stack website to track telephone poles in Seattle and Kelowna.
- 🦠 [**Label Transfer Algorithm**](https://github.com/sjsikora/bayesian-scRNAseq-label-transfer): *R* As part of my internship at the Trapnell Lab, I developed a pipeline to transfer cell labels from a reference to a query single-cell dataset accurately.
- 📈 **Dash Data Visualization**: *Python* A website to view and interact with Variational Auto Encoder Double Knockout Data, Olympic Rowing Data, Supreme Court Data, and Genetically Engineered Crop Data.
- 👩‍🏫 [**UBC Class API**](https://github.com/sjsikora/UBC-Class-Api): *Python* Turns UBC Class data into JSON files.
- 🎵 [**Playlist Board**](https://github.com/sjsikora/Playlist-Board): *Python* Turn your top listened-to albums into a photo to share with your friends.
- 📷 [**Photo/Birthday Discord Bot**](https://github.com/sjsikora/Discord-Bot): *Javascript* Can never remember your friends birthdays? Or do you want to find an embarrassing photo of them? This bot will manage the photos and birthdays of the members of your server. NOTE: This project is private due to its containing sensitive information.
